                                <li>
                                    Modified the Security authentication to differentiate between the SOAP and REST web
                                    services for the micro
                                    application platform.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Modified each method of the REST endpoints so that it will support both the XML and
                                    JSON
                                    format without
                                    changing the existing logic of the SOAP endpoint.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Documented the REST web services in the swagger platform using the YAML and JSON
                                    format.
                                </li>
